# VBA-challenge
<br /> 1. In this challege we gone through a woorkbook with differnet sheets, which contains different data for different stocks.
<br /> 2. For our assignment we are suppose to find out the ticker symbol for different stocks, greatest increase in stocks, grestest decrease in stocks, total volume of a particular stock and the percentage of the relevant change.
<br /> 3. I have tried to approach this by setting up diffenet variable for the worksheet which we would be using for diffenent calculations and references.
<br /> 4. We need this code to work for all the worksheets in the workbook. For this I have looped all the worksheets in the workbook. 
<br /> 5. First I have determined the last row of ticker and then using that to find the next ticker value in the sheet. 
<br /> 6. After this, I used this cell value to determine the yearly change in value and percent change in value.
<br /> 7. After finding this I have looped this for the next ticker on the same work sheet.
<br /> 8. Now using the values I have determined the Greatest increase and Decrease in the value and thieir total volume. 
<br /> 9. Once I have done this for one sheet, this loop works on all the sheets of the workbook.
